# Convolution Augmented Transformers

This repository holds three different repositories for the code of my Master Thesis at TU Munich. We introduce convolution augmented transformers and achieve promising results on Point Cloud Classification and Segmentation using Transformers and Convolutions.

This repository is a merger repository for individual problems we have tested during the thesis. These are as follows:
- **Base Model**: This repository holds the Convolutional Augmented Transformers code. It is in Pytorch Lightning and Point Cloud Classification is done on ModelNet40 Dataset. Original repository is [here](https://github.com/nazmicancalik/thesis)
- **Classification PCT PT**: This folder holds the pipeline for testing the convolutional block on both Point Cloud Transformer and Point Transformer. Classification on ModelNet40 and Part Segmentation on ShapeNet Part dataset are done here. Original repository is [here](https://github.com/nazmicancalik/pc-transformers-with-convolution)
-  **Scene Segmentation PT**: This folder holds the pipeline for testing the convolutional block on both Point Point Transformer on S3DIS Scene Segmentation problem. Original repository is [here](https://github.com/nazmicancalik/point-transformer)

Necessary instructions are given on how to run the corresponding code base.
